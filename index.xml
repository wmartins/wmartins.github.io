      <description>Monitoring your infrastructure is one of the most important aspects of successfully launching a product. It&amp;rsquo;s really important to know when your machines/applications are under heavy load. Moreover, if it happens, you would want to quickly know what&amp;rsquo;s going on and what you can do to recover your infrastructure.
This blog post explains how you can configure setup a monitoring stack easily using Docker Swarm, Grafana, InfluxDB and Telegraf.</description>

      <description>About If you are seeing this, you probably want to know more about me. So, as Roling Stones would say
 &amp;ldquo;Please allow me to introduce myself&amp;rdquo;:
 My name is William Martins and I&amp;rsquo;m a computer scientist who loves to code new stuff and who believes that the web is the way.
I started programming when I was 14 (in Pascal) and never stopped! I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself doing anything else.</description>
