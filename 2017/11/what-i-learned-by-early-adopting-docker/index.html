<p>
  The year is 2015, I started working as software engineer in this new team that
  was focused on delivering new experiences with top notch technology. This was
  also an year when microservices began to be a thing, and, with that, Docker
  being the <em>de facto</em> containerization tool.
</p>
<p>
  At this time, Docker was on release <code>1.6</code> or <code>1.7</code>, and few people were using it
  to deploy applications. Lots of those were POCs, and most of the blog posts
  included some "strange" things (not the Netflix title) there, like the <code>fig</code>
  command (which became <code>docker-compose</code>), and lots of lines in <code>yml</code> code.
</p>
<p>
  It was a time where most of the "real world problems" were still being found for
  Docker deployments. Things like networking, orchestration, high availability,
  and so on. So, we made a few bad decisions that made us learn a lot (at least
  what not to do), but that we would like someone had told us that were bad ideas.
</p>
<p>
  This blog post will cover some of those bad decisions, explaining why they're
  bad, and what we should've done.
</p>
<h2>Outlining the Application</h2>
<p>
  Our application, in a high level, was designed to be high available, which means
  that, at least, we needed to run our application in more than one machine. That
  said, we needed to be able to run replicas of containers, and provide a
  mechanism to use those replicas in the best way we can.
</p>
<p>In our case, we decided to use <a href="https://openresty.org/en/"><strong>OpenResty</strong></a> (Nginx</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Lua Scripts) as a reverse proxy/API gateway/load balancer, balancing the
    traffic between the containers. Something like that:
  </li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs language-conf">upstream first-microservice {
    server &#x3C;FIRST-SERVER-IP>:8877;
    server &#x3C;SECOND-SERVER-IP>:8877;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  After we decided what goes where, we then took two bad decisions: orchestrate
  the application using <a href="https://jenkins.io/"><strong>Jenkins</strong></a> and creating a
  <code>configuration</code> volume, which I'll cover in next sections.
</p>
<h2>Orchestrating Using Jenkins</h2>
<p><strong>Jenkins</strong> is an awesome tool. It does its job really well:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The leading open source <strong>automation</strong> server, Jenkins provides hundreds of
    plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  As you see, it's an <strong>automation</strong> server. Putting it in another way, it's
  <strong>not</strong> an orchestration server. But, for some reason, we thought it was.
</p>
<p>
  So, our deployment jobs now had the IPs of all our machines, containing a Groovy
  script to associate an IP with container names (in order to know what to
  deploy). Then, a generic deploy job just grabbed the IP, the names, ssh'd into
  the machines and <em>voila</em>, let <code>docker-compose up -d &#x3C;CONTAINERS></code> do its job.
</p>
<p>
  It seems good, right? It felt good. It really did, but it started to become hard
  to manage. Every new microservice we added, we needed to edit this Jenkins job
  and add the new microservice in <strong>all</strong> environments (we have 2 QA environments,
  1 <em>production like</em> environment and 1 production environment). And, there was <strong>no
space for mistakes</strong> here. If you edit it wrong, your service will go to the
  wrong machine, and the application might not work. Also, if you put, for
  example, two applications that consume lots of memory in the same machine, you
  might compromise this machine, just because you chose the wrong place to put
  your microservice.
</p>
<p>
  So, as I said before, we found out that Jenkins is not an orchestration tool.
  It doesn't handle unhealthy services/machines, it doesn't handle dynamic
  adding/removing replicas, it doesn't monitor your replicas. It just automates
  stuff.
</p>
<p>
  Now, the plan is to move this responsibility from Jenkins to <strong>Docker Swarm</strong>,
  which will also gives us other cool features that fix more of our problems.
</p>
<p>
  There are other tools, like <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and <strong>Nomad</strong>, that also solves this
  in a fashion way.
</p>
<h2>No Service Discovery/Hardcoded IPs</h2>
<p>
  Service discovery is one of the most important aspects of a successful
  microservices architecture. Without it, you'll struggle when adding/removing
  replicas from the application.
</p>
<p>
  We found out that after having some problems on some of our machines (our
  infrastructure team had an outage on a datacenter, which took half of our
  machines down). In that time, we wanted to add more replicas to make the
  application high available again. It was really hard to do:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Editing IPs in Jenkins and config files</li>
  <li>Going in Jenkins jobs to modify where to deploy stuff</li>
  <li>Deploy and check if everything is running fine</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Then, after the machines went up again, we needed to do the reverse process,
  editing files, modifying Jenkins and deploying, all over again.
</p>
<p>
  It's not that hard to setup a <code>DNS</code> or a service discovery system. So, don't let
  the "lets ship it soon" make you do things that will only cause you trouble. Or,
  if you do, at least know what you need to do to make it right.
</p>
<h2>Configuration as a Shared Volume</h2>
<p>
  All applications, at some point, need some kind of configuration. Most likely,
  the application, when in production, will need to behave differently than in the
  local machine, or in a low level (testing) environment. This requires us to have
  some level of <strong>configuration management</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Back at that time, the way we solved it was to create a <strong>configuration
volume</strong>, that is a simple Docker container that we use to store configuration
  files per environment. Then, at deployment time, we just grab the correct
  configuration container and we deploy it using <code>--volumes-from</code> directive.
</p>
<p>
  It seemed to be a good idea, but we started realizing that it doesn't scale.
  First of all, we were coupling all microservices with this configuration
  container, and we needed to always remember to edit the files in it. Second, our
  microservices weren't really standalone, as we couldn't run it without running
  this other container together. Third, if two containers used the version
  <code>2.1.0</code> of the configuration container, they would end up using exactly the same
  files. Putting it in another way, if, by mistake, one container edits the wrong
  file, it could affect the other container. To finish, it starts to be really
  hard to manage which is the correct configuration version to run with each
  microservice.
</p>
<p>
  There are some ways to do it correctly. One of the easiest is to use
  <strong>environment variables</strong> for all those configuration objects. If the
  application requires a string to connect to the database, provide a
  <code>DB_CONNECTION_STRING</code> env var and so on.
</p>
<p>
  The other way of using it is to use a <strong>configuration management tool</strong> that let
  you externalize your configuration. Tools like <strong>Consul</strong> with its key-value
  storage solve that for you. The only downside is that you'll need to modify your
  applications to connect to that tool to grab the values. The cool thing about
  it is that you can, in the middle of the day, change some configuration and,
  if your code supports it, your application will notice that and will adapt
  itself. It's really nice.
</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>
  It was really hard to early adopt Docker. We made a few poor decisions that
  we're not proud of. Also, those decisions made our jobs pretty hard. If, at that
  time, we discussed more and researched more, we would probably doing things
  better.
</p>
<p>
  That said, my advice if you're adopting Docker (but that can be used to
  anything) is to study a lot, discuss in forums and experiment with it. Try to
  implement all your use cases and think what you'll need when running in
  production, and check if you have the tools and knowledge to make you go
  comfortably to production.
</p>
<p>Hope it was useful!</p>

Third, if two containers used the version\n  \u003ccode\u003e2.1.0\u003c/code\u003e of the configuration container, they would end up using exactly the same\n  files. Putting it in another way, if, by mistake, one container edits the wrong\n  file, it could affect the other container. To finish, it starts to be really\n  hard to manage which is the correct configuration version to run with each\n  microservice.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  There are some ways to do it correctly. One of the easiest is to use\n  \u003cstrong\u003eenvironment variables\u003c/strong\u003e for all those configuration objects. If the\n  application requires a string to connect to the database, provide a\n  \u003ccode\u003eDB_CONNECTION_STRING\u003c/code\u003e env var and so on.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  The other way of using it is to use a \u003cstrong\u003econfiguration management tool\u003c/strong\u003e that let\n  you externalize your configuration. Tools like \u003cstrong\u003eConsul\u003c/strong\u003e with its key-value\n  storage solve that for you. The only downside is that you'll need to modify your\n  applications to connect to that tool to grab the values. The cool thing about\n  it is that you can, in the middle of the day, change some configuration and,\n  if your code supports it, your application will notice that and will adapt\n  itself. It's really nice.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWrapping Up\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  It was really hard to early adopt Docker. We made a few poor decisions that\n  we're not proud of. Also, those decisions made our jobs pretty hard. If, at that\n  time, we discussed more and researched more, we would probably doing things\n  better.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  That said, my advice if you're adopting Docker (but that can be used to\n  anything) is to study a lot, discuss in forums and experiment with it. Try to\n  implement all your use cases and think what you'll need when running in\n  production, and check if you have the tools and knowledge to make you go\n  comfortably to production.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope it was useful!\u003c/p\u003e\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"6:[\"$\",\"article\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"page_titleContainer__tlZMv\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"page_title__Tljh5\",\"children\":\"What I Learned by Early Adopting Docker\"}],[\"$\",\"time\",null,{\"className\":\"datetime_datetime__ZMgNO\",\"dateTime\":\"10:09:43 PM\",\"children\":\"Nov 28, 2017\"}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"page_post__iBPNz\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$f\"}}],[\"$\",\"footer\",null,{\"className\":\"page_footer__MFEyq\",\"children\":[\"Tags:\",\" \",[[\"$\",\"$L3\",\"docker\",{\"className\":\"page_tag__9Ktix\",\"href\":\"/tags/docker\",\"children\":\"docker\"}],[\"$\",\"$L3\",\"orchestration\",{\"className\":\"page_tag__9Ktix\",\"href\":\"/tags/orchestration\",\"children\":\"orchestration\"}]]]}]]}]\n9:null\nd:[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"What I Learned by Early Adopting Docker\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"The year is 2015, I started working as software engineer in this new team that\\nwas focused on delivering new experiences with top notch...\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"What I Learned by Early Adopting Docker\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"The year is 2015, I started working as software engineer in this new team that\\nwas focused on delivering new experiences with top notch...\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"What I Learned by Early Adopting Docker\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"The year is 2015, I started working as software engineer in this new team that\\nwas focused on delivering new experiences with top notch...\"}]]\n"])</script></body></html>
