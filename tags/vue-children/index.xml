      <description>I got myself inspired by Max Stoiber in his A deep dive into children in React to create this post about Vue children. So, credits on the title to him. If you&#39;re into React, check out his post, it has lots of nice information on React children.
Motivation I have started working with Vue a few months ago and it has been really nice. After working with React for some years, it&#39;s nice to experience something new.</description>
