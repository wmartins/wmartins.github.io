This post is just a collection of information about how to implement
[SafetyNet Attestation
API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation) in
your application.

This whole thing started weeks ago after my team was researching a way
to block suspicious requests that were occurring in our authentication
API. There were lots of different users trying to log in, from different
IP addresses/ranges. We already had a
[WAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall) set up,
however, in this scenario, this was not effective. We think that there
had been a data breach with lots of users and passwords, therefore,
attackers were using these information to try a _lucky guess_ in our
API, almost like a brute-force attack.

Our first attempt was to use
[reCAPTCHA](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/recaptcha)
as our mechanism to block those requests. However, we've found that user
experience using this mechanism was really bad, as reCAPTCHA is an
intrusive approach (even though it has an invisible option). After some
research, we decided to give a try to use SafetyNet Attestation API.

## How SafetyNet Attestation API replaces reCAPTCHA?

In our scenario, the problem we were trying to solve was to separate
malicious attacks from real login attempts from our clients. In other
words, we wanted to know if a login attempt was occurring from an
automation script or from a _real_ device.

Therefore, when we know we have a _real_ device, we allow the user to
log in, otherwise, we just block the request.

## SafetyNet Attestation API implementation: device

I'll not get into lots of details about the device implementation,
however, it's pretty straightforward:
https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation#request-attestation-step.

## SafetyNet Attestation API implementation: token verification

First and foremost, you need to have in mind that the token verification
**is up to you**. There are some tutorials and even a [code in google
samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-safetynet/blob/d7513a54e2f28c0dcd7f8d8d0fa03adb5d87b91a/server/csharp/OnlineVerify.cs#L45-L46)
that verifies the token for you using an online API. However, this
should **not be your production approach**.

In order to verify the token, we must first understand what this token
represents. The token is a
[JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-36)
token. If you want, you'll be able to parse this token using simple
`jwt` tools. For example, one may use https://jwt.io/ debugger to get
the token information, or use any standard `jwt` implementation.

A valid SafetyNet token will have a header that looks like this:

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "x5c": [
    "signing certificate as base64 goes here",
    "issuer certificate as base64 goes here"
  ]
}
```

And it will have a payload that looks like this:

```json
{
  "timestampMs": 9860437986543,
  "nonce": "R2Rra24fVm5xa2Mg",
  "apkPackageName": "com.package.name.of.requesting.app",
  "apkCertificateDigestSha256": ["base64 encoded, SHA-256 hash of the
                                  certificate used to sign requesting app"],
  "ctsProfileMatch": true,
  "basicIntegrity": true,
}
```

If you want, you can have the payload representation as follows (in
Go):

```go
// Attestation response from Google SafetyNet Attestation API
type Attestation struct {
	TimestampMs                int64    `json:"timestampMs"`                // time when response was generated by Google's servers
	Nonce                      string   `json:"nonce"`                      // single use token
	ApkPackageName             string   `json:"apkPackageName"`             // calling app's package name
	ApkCertificateDigestSha256 []string `json:"apkCertificateDigestSha256"` // base64 encoded representation of SHA-256 hash of the calling app signing certificate
	CtsProfileMatch            bool     `json:"ctsProfileMatch"`            // stricter veredict of device integrity
	BasicIntegrity             bool     `json:"basicIntegrity"`             // a more lenient veredict of device integrity
	Error                      string   `json:"error"`                      // error occured from API request
	Advice                     string   `json:"advice"`                     // suggestion on how to get device back into a good state
}
```

Now you're wondering what you should do with that information. [And
you're not
alone](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-safetynet/issues/21).
There are many pieces of information and you must decide what to use.

One thing that is really important to be done is to verify if the
token is valid. You can do that using standard `jws` tools. If you
search for terms like _jws_ and _jose_ you might find some tools for
your preferred language. If you're using Go, you can use
[`go-jose`](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/square/go-jose.v2). Here goes an
example on how to check the validity of a JWS token:

```go
func Validate(token string) {
	signedAttestation, err := jose.ParseSigned(token)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error on parse signed attestation: %s", err)
	}
}
```

After that, you need to check if that message was signed by Google
itself. If you saw before, we have a
[`x5c`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-36#section-4.1.6)
property on the header. This information says two things: first, who
signed the JWS token itself. Second, who signed the certificate that
signed the JWS token. In other words, it's a [certificate
chain](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280).

There are lots of solutions for validating a certificate chain. If
you're using Go and `go-jose`, it's pretty straightforward to do that:

```go
func ValidateSafetyNetAttesationToken(token string) {
	// remaining code

	// uses default system root CAs to validate
	opts := x509.VerifyOptions{}
	certs, err := signedAttestation.Signatures[0].Header.Certificates(opts)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error on validating certificates: %s", err)
	}
}
```

Now that you know that the message is really sent by Google, the next
step is to get its payload. The payload can be used to check device
integrity (for example, to check if the phone is not rooted). Here is an
example on how to do that:

```go
func ValidateSafetyNetAttesationToken(token string) {
	// remaining code

	attestationPayload, err := signedAttestation.Verify(certs[0][0].PublicKey)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error on verifying attestation: %s", err)
	}

	attestation := &Attestation{}

	json.Unmarshal(attestationPayload, &attestation)

	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", attestation)
}
```

Now, it's up to you to do whatever you want. I recommend to check if all
the fields match the values you expect. Some ideas:

- Verify if `apkCertificateDigestSha256` matches the fingerprint of the
  certificate that was used to sign the app (only your team should have
  the private key to do that)
- Verify if `apkPackageName` matches the package that should call the
  Attestation API
- Verify the value from [`basicIntegrity` and
  `ctsProfileMatch`](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation#potential-integrity-verdicts)
- Verify if the provided timestamp is in a specific range/time limit
  (for example, consider it expired if generated 10 minutes ago)
- I couldn't find a practical case for using the `nonce`, however, you
  can use it to match if the information given by the client is what you
  expected. This, combined with some cryptography strategy, makes it
  even harder for an attacker to "guess" the nonce

Hope you find it helpful!
