# About

If you are seeing this, you probably want to know more about me. So, as Roling
Stones would say

> "Please allow me to introduce myself":

My name is William Martins and I'm a computer scientist who loves to code new
stuff and who believes that the web is the way.

I started programming when I was 14 (in Pascal) and never stopped! I can't see
myself doing anything else.

I'm currently working as a software developer at ADP, working with web
technologies like **HTML**, **JavaScript (React)**, **CSS (PostCSS, SASS,
Aphrodite)**.

I'm also interested in things like:

* LaTeX
* Functional Programming
* Clojure
* Go (Golang)
* Distributed Computing
* System Design
* Vim
* Bash

If you want to get in touch, check how you can [contact]({{<ref "contact.md">}})
me.
